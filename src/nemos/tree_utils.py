    Identify non-infinite entries within an array.

    This function evaluates each element in the input array to determine whether it is finite (not infinite).
    It performs this check across all axes except the first one, aggregating results using a logical 'AND' operation.
    Thus, for a given element along the first axis, if all corresponding elements in other dimensions are finite,
    the result is True; otherwise, it is False.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : jnp.ndarray
        Input array to check for infinite values.

    Returns
    -------
        A 1D boolean array of length equal to the size of the first dimension of the input array.
        Each entry in this array corresponds to an aggregation across all other dimensions of the input array,
        with True indicating all values are finite (not infinite) and False indicating at least one infinite value.

    Identify non-NaN (Not a Number) entries within an array.

    Similar to the _get_not_inf function, this function checks each element in the input array for being non-NaN across
    all axes except the first one. It aggregates these checks using a logical 'AND' operation. An element along the
    first axis is considered valid (True) if all its corresponding elements in other dimensions are not NaN.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array :
        The input array for which to check for NaN values.

    Returns
    -------

    valid if all its entries are finite and not NaN. The function assumes homogeneous first dimension across all leaves.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree :
        A pytree with leaves as NDArrays sharing the same size for the first dimension.

    Returns
    -------

    Parameters

    Apply a mapping function to each leaf of the pytrees and then reduce the results.

    aggregate these results into a single output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    map_fn :
        A function to be applied to each leaf of the pytrees. This function should
        take a single argument and return a single value.

        A function that reduces the mapped results. This function should take an
