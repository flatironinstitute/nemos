    """
    Apply a convolution on the given array with the evaluation basis and reshapes the result.

    This function first flattens the input array across dimensions other than the first one, then
    performs a vectorized convolution with the evaluation basis. The result is reshaped back to the
    original array's shape (except for the first dimension, which is adjusted based on the convolution).

    Parameters
    ----------
    array :
        The input array to convolve. It is expected to be at least 1D. The first axis is expeted to be
        the sample axis, i.e. the shape of array is ``(num_samples, ...)``.
    eval_basis :
        The evaluation basis array for convolution. It should be 2D, where the first dimension
        represents the window size for convolution. Shape ``(window_size, n_basis_funcs)``.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        The convolved array, reshaped to maintain the original dimensions except for the first one,
        which is adjusted based on the window size of ``eval_basis``.

    Notes
    -----
    The convolution implemented here is in mode ``"valid"``. This implies that the time axis shrinks
    ``num_samples - window_size + 1``, where num_samples is the first size of the first axis of ``array``
    and ``window_size`` is the size of the first axis in ``eval_basis``.

    To create the convolutional predictor, three steps are taken, convolve, pad and shift.

      causality of intended predictor (function: `nemos.utils.nan_pad`).
    - (Optional) Shift predictor based on causality (function: `nemos.utils.shift_time_series`)

    The function is designed to handle both single arrays and pynapple time series with data
     (across multiple epochs), as well as their combinations. For pynapple time series, it
    treats each epoch separately, applies the convolution process, and then reassembles the time series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis_matrix :
        A 2D array representing the basis matrix to convolve with the time series.
        The first dimension should represent the window size for the convolution.
    time_series :
        The time series data to convolve with the basis matrix. Can be single arrays, pytree of arrays,
        pynapple time series, pytree of pynapple time series or a mix.
        In case of Pynapple time series data, each epoch will be convolved separately.
    predictor_causality :
        The causality of the predictor, determining how the padding and shifting
        should be applied to the convolution result.
        - 'causal': Pads and/or shifts the result to be causal with respect to the input.
        - 'acausal': Applies padding equally on both sides without shifting.
        - 'anti-causal': Pads and/or shifts the result to be anti-causal with respect to the input.
    shift :
        Determines whether to shift the convolution result based on the causality.
        If None, it defaults to True for 'causal' and 'anti-causal' and to False for 'acausal'.
    axis :
        The axis along which the convolution is applied.

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The convolutional predictor, structured similarly to the input `time_series`, appropriately
        padded and shifted according to the specified causality.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        If `basis_matrix` is not a 2-dimensional array or has a singleton first dimension.
    ValueError:
        If `time_series` does not contain arrays of at least one dimension or contains
        arrays with a dimensionality less than `axis`.
    ValueError:
        If any array within `time_series` or `basis_matrix` is empty.
    ValueError:
        If the number of elements along the convolution axis in any array within `time_series`
