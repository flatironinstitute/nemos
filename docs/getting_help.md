# Getting Help

We communicate via several channels on Github:

- To report a bug, open an
  [issue](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos/issues).
- To ask usage questions, discuss broad issues, or show off what you’ve made
  with NeMoS, go to
  [Discussions](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos/discussions).
- To send suggestions for extensions or enhancements, please post in the
  [ideas](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos/discussions/categories/ideas)
  section of discussions first. We’ll discuss it there and, if we decide to
  pursue it, open an issue to track progress.
- To contribute to the project, see the [contributing
  guide](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

In all cases, we request that you respect our [code of
conduct](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos?tab=coc-ov-file).
